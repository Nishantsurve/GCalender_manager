- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn** (optional) - [Install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
# Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL of the repository
git clone https://github.com/Nishantsurve/GCalender_manager.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd <nishants>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

yarn install
```

### 3. Start the Development Server

Run the following command to start the development server:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run dev

```

The development server will start, and you can view the application by visiting [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

### 4. Build for Production
